let's understand the feature engineering:
scaling and transformation is the essential preporcessing step in ml that prepare data for better model performance and reliability

ensure the features contribute equally to the model
-> Feature Transformation :
it is modifying the distribution or structure of data feature to make them more suitable for modeling. take note modifying not converting.

It involes :
	Changing the shape of the distribution: (more use bell curve , uses normality) 
	stabilizing varaiance and minizing skewness: (help handling heteroskcedasticity / hetroscedasticity( means when 		std of predicted vairable , may be non-constant , moniter over a different values of independent variable or 		as related to prior time periods, are non-constant)		
		making the data more amenable to statistical modeling.
	Traget transformation : applied to a target variable in regression task to improve model fit.


some of the tecquines : 
Log, bining, interactions

Feature Scaling :
it is a specific type of transformation that adjusts the range or distribution of numerical feature so they are comparable.

why is it matters 
cuz it improves model accuracy algo like k-nearest neighbors ,SVM(support vector machine ),speeds up convergence, enhances interpretability

Common Methods : Standaridization (method of feature scaling in which data vales are rescaled to fit distribution b/w 0,1 .
Normalization (what if our model is follow noraml distribuiton , used for scaling non-normal data is called max-min narmalization , again it scaling b/w (0,1) but the values are asinged based on there position of the data. 
another apporach is unit-vector based ( part of normalization in which length of a vector or row is stretched to a unit sphere in a visual format.

models and apporach to scaling :

|	Types of algo             |	Feature Scaling Approach    |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
| Principle Component Analysis    | Standardization 		    |
| K- Nearest Neighbors            | Normalization                   |
| SVM 				  | Standardization 		    |
| Logistic regression 		  | Normalization                   |	
| Neural Networks                 | Normalization                   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Note : transformation and scaling not always requried in tree based algo /models( decision tree , random forest) 


Feature Encoding : part of feature enginreering
It is converting the categroical variable like text labels or odinal) into a numerical format that machine learning algo can process.

Common Encoding Techinques :
One - Hot Encoding 
Label Encoding 
ordinal Encoding
numeric Encoding
Cyclical Encoding (used in calender)
