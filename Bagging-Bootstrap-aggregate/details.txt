Bagging /Bootstrap Aggregate:
Methods such as Decision Tress, can be prone to overfiting on the training set which can lead to wrong predictions on new data.

Understanding by points:
1. it is a method to resolve overfitting for classification or regression problems
2. it improve the accuracy and performance of ML algos
3. by taking random subsets of original dataset resolve the overfitting
