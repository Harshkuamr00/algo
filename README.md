Welcome to the "Learn Machine Learning Algorithms with Python" repository!
This project is a practical, code-first resource for mastering machine learning algorithms using Python.
It features clean implementations, dataset management, and visualizations for each model—organized for easy learning and reference.
🚀 Project Overview

This repository is designed for learners and practitioners who want to understand, implement, and visualize core machine learning algorithms from scratch.
Each algorithm is implemented in a dedicated folder with code, explanations, datasets, and visualizations.
You can use this as a reference, a learning tool, or a starting point for your own ML projects.
